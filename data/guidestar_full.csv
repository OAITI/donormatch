He strongly believed that corporations have an obligation to their communities, and believed both giving and volunteering are vital to building and maintaining healthy communities. As Aetna's Chairman in 1972, Filer created the Aetna Foundation, the independent philanthropic arm of Aetna. In 1973, President Richard Nixon asked Filer to head the Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs to study the role of philanthropy in the United States. The Commission became known as the ""Filer Commission."" Legacy of Caring While Filer made Aetna a national leader in corporate philanthropy, the company's legacy of giving and helping others actually began long before his tenure and the Aetna Foundation. Aetna's annual employee United Way/Combined Health Charities Appeal Campaign was initiated in 1931. In 1944, Aetna volunteers, after a tragic circus fire in Hartford, Connecticut, provided extra staffing to hospitals and first aid shelters. In 1959, Aetna President Harry Beers identified corporate responsibility and employee volunteerism as key business objectives, articulating a philosophy that had long been in practice. These activities set the stage for the culture of caring that continues today. Through the Aetna Foundation, Aetna has supported America's most compelling issues in its home state of Connecticut and nationally. The Aetna Foundation has strengthened disease prevention programs; helped revitalize neighborhoods; supported the arts, education and people in need; and listened to the voices of difference that shape our nation. Since 1980 Aetna and the Aetna Foundation have contributed over $334 million in grants and sponsorships.",68153472,www.aetna.com/foundation,https://www.guidestar.org/profile/23-7241940

Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death, and although most strokes occur to people 65 or older, stroke can attack people of any age or gender.But experts in vascular medicine say that fully eight out of every ten strokes can be prevented. That means we have it in our power to reduce the annual incidence of stroke from 795,000 to less than 160,000, The key is awareness. Only a fraction of the American population understands the lifestyle and medical steps they need to take to keep them out of the high-risk stroke pool. Fewer than one in five can recognize the symptoms of a stroke at its onset.The RTH Stroke Foundation aggressively pursues this under informed segment of our population. Every year we hold free stroke awareness seminars for several thousand attendees at which experts in the field explain what people have to do to reduce the likelihood of stroke. We conduct free diagnostic screenings for aneurysms, blood pressure, carotid narrowing and cholesterol. These screenings identify people at various stages of risk, including some whose lives may have been literally saved because they had no idea that they had an aneurysm or a severely restricted carotid. And we hold free monthly stroke support meetings to help stroke victims, their families and caregivers learn how to adjust to the stroke victim's new normal.The quest to reduce the incidence of stroke so drastically may seem Quixotic to some, but not to us.

Jane Goodall and others like her who have done field studies of primates in their natural habitat have shown that dedicated individuals are one of the keys to successful conservation. PCI provides grants to support the next generation of researchers and conservationists in the field. These grantees research the needs of species,  focusing the attention of  local people and the world. In many cases they are the endangered primates only defense against hunters and loggers.               PCI has also funded projects on better known species including orangutans, gorillas, bonobos and chimps.            In order to save this vast store house of the natural world's biodiversity, many more people need to be involved in conservation. The people PCI supports are committed to protect these species and their habitats. You can help PCI fund researchers in the tropical forests doing this important conservation work.

Many other horses have been shipped to Akindale from national organizations such as TRF and Mid Atlantic Horse Rescue because ATBR provides safe haven for horses that can no longer race, are in their prime, and are ready for new careers or to be companion animals.     Akindale is a nationally recognized name, synonymous with the cause.  While in the past ATRB has made valuable contributions in saving many thoroughbreds, there are so many more still needing to be rescued.    In order to fulfill its mission of ""providing a safe haven for thoroughbreds no longer able to race"" the ATBR has expanded its goals.  Realizing that more horses need to be responsibly adopted to private owners, so more can be taken in, they are committed to training and more aggressive communication about the adoption program.    This will require skilled staff, state of the art facilities and the generosity of the community of horse lovers.",133585,akindalehorserescue.org,https://www.guidestar.org/profile/20-1822473

From One Hand To AnOTHER (FOHTA) was founded by internationally known musical artist and producer Pharrell Williams in 2009 because he believed that every child could be a success if only they had the right tools. Pharrell Williams grew up in Virginia Beach in the Seatack neighborhood. Times were tough but his family was strong and he was lucky enough to find his tool for the future: music. That discovery changed his life and is the reason he is successful today.  Pharrell credits his music teacher helping him make something of his gift, teaching him discipline, and never giving up on him. Says Pharrell, “Our organization, From One Hand to Another, is committed to bringing kids experiences that ignite their passions, challenge their minds and prepare them for success.""    Pharrell believes that if every community with under-served youth had access to programs devoted to augmenting the learning experience, and providing exposure to different technologies, arts and resources, kids can find their own tool – their key to a successful and fulfilling future. Since 2004, Pharrell has been a benefactor for programs in Virginia Beach including the Back to School Supplies donation program and the distribution of Thanksgiving turkeys to residents of the neighborhood in which he grew up.    In 2009, FOHTA launched our first Summer of Innovation camp in affiliation with NASA as part of President Obama's “Educate to Innovate"" STEM initiative. Since that time, we have offered free after-school and Summer Innovation camps to children in the Virginia Beach and Hampton Bays area.

52-2286496,Voices for Sudan,"The countries of Sudan and South Sudan are presently at a crossroads. Despite secession, South Sudan and Sudan still have not achieved a peaceful coexistence.  Violent clashes over natural resources, ethnic tension, and human displacement plague both countries and the surrounding nations.  There is still work that needs to be done to stop the violence.     Voices for Sudan (VFS) hopes to advocate for this necessary change. VFS empowers those most influential and most affected by the conflict, the Sudanese Diaspora. Most times, Sudanese voices are often absent or limited during press and advocacy outreach. Voices for Sudan provides decision makers and interested parties with valuable insights into the viewpoints and experience of Sudanese from various regions across the Sudans. VFS creates a forum for the diverse Diaspora to come together, allowing for a more holistic and nuanced policy approach to solving the issues that plague the Sudans.  VFS bridges the conversation, by bringing stakeholders together and coming up with innovative solutions to a very complicated and ethnically tense history. This forum for the Sudanese and South Sudanese Diaspora not only allows for an increased understanding, but also allows VFS to depict a more accurate picture of the conflicts and the solutions that need to be established to create peace.     For two decades, Sudan has been in the headlines because of the horrendous violence, religious and ethnic manipulation, and human rights abuses that have resulted in hundreds of millions of deaths, refugees, internally displaced people, and ruined lives. Sudan borders Egypt and straddles Northern Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, thus its problems have a direct impact on its African and Middle East neighbors. People of conscience   -- especially in the U.S. to where tens of thousands of Sudanese have immigrated to escape war, poverty, and slavery -- can play a significant role in ending this litany of despair, establishing a democratic model, and preventing terrorism in Africa by helping Sudanese take control of their own destiny.",17904,www.voicesforsudan.org,https://www.guidestar.org/profile/52-2286496
